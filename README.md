Project's Title
TTA Bio Repository

Project Description
This is a repostory that contains my bio, for the purpose of displaying my ability in creating repositories for SDI1000.

I used VSCode to create the files, and Git and Github to publish them. 
Some of the challenges I faced in creating the repository was that my Git was operating under a different user than my Github, so the number of contributors did not match the number of people actually working on the project.

Credits
I used the Module 1 videos and resources from SDI1000 to make this repository.
